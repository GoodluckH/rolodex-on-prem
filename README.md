<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Networking is very important in one's career. Coming from a finance background, I deeply understand that Wall Street is all about whom you know. However, people are still managing their "modern" rolodex on spreadsheets with hundreds of rows of contacts, in 2021! It's even more of a hassle to access the spreadsheet to update and browse contacts. You'd have to open up your computer, going through folders after folders to locate your spreadsheet, and wait for minutes for it to load up, and to jot down something about someone whom you just grabbed coffee with. 

This project aims to eliminate frictions for professional network management. It is an on-premise version because the project uses MongoDB to store contact information. For now, users need to create their own MongoDB Atlas database to store their own information.

The Rolodex demo communicates with my own Atlas database (open access for all public IPs). For that reason, the demo is more like a crowd-sourced version of Rolodex. Please be civil when trying out the demo because everyone can see what's on the rolodex. 

### User Interface

Rolodex is a simple, one-page web app that mainly consists of three interfaces.
